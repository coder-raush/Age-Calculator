# Age Calculator

Age Calculator is a simple web project built using only pure HTML. It allows users to enter their Date of Birth and shows the current date as the Target Date. The age must be calculated manually by comparing the two dates. This project does not use any JavaScript or CSS and is ideal for beginners learning basic HTML structure and form elements.
